## About The Project

This project is named as Global Inflation Analyzer (GIA). It is a python library, and written to give a comprehensive analysis of inflation rate. The library can be used to perform analysis based on a given dataset with the classification standard of classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP 2-5-digit hierarchy). 

With the dataset contained data about consumer price index for group of products and services, the library will analyze the following main questions or features: 

      1. How much has inflation changed during the given range of years? 
      2. In what amount, inflation recorded after or before specific year (e.g. COVID-19 or UKRAIN WAR)? 
      3. Which group of products or services is highly affected after specific year? 
      4. In which year was high inflation recorded?
      5. What is the inflation rate of a specific products or services globally?
      6. What is the inflation rate of a specific products or services group (specific Country)?
