# <u>Software Architecture and Design</u>

## <u>Overview</u>

This project is named as Global Inflation Analyzer (GIA). It is a python library, and written to give a comprehensive analysis of inflation rate. The library can be used to perform analysis based on a given dataset with the classification standard of classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP 2-5-digit hierarchy).

The preprocessor class contains internal functions `_index_cleaning(), _data_cleaning() and _get_relative_data_directory()` that are used by the external functions `list_products(), list_countries() and list_year()` which inform the user about the available options for the software. The function `by_product()` provides a Pandas DataFrame as an output containing all countries and all time periods available. Similarly, `by_country()` return a Pandas DataFrame with chosen countries for a specific product and `by_year()` returns a Pandas DataFrame for chosen time period, countries and product.

These functions can be accessed from the Analyser class. `set_datafile()` is used to select the data with which you want to proceed with the analysis. `inflation_calculator()` calculates the inflation rate from the CPI of the chosen product and country/countries.

## <u>Data Flow</u>

### A. Preprocessor Class

##### 1. Constructor (`__init__`):

- The `Preprocessor` class initializes by setting the **data_folder** attribute using the `_get_relative_data_directory()` method, which obtains the relative data directory path.
- The **files** attribute is set by creating a list of file paths within the data_folder using the os.listdir function and a list comprehension.

##### 2. Index Cleaning (`_index_cleaning()`):

- The `_index_cleaning()` method takes a list of DataFrame indexes as input. It cleans the indexes by capitalizing the countries, trimming edges and removing spaces.
- The cleaned index list is returned to the calling function.

##### 3. Data Cleaning (`_data_cleaning()`):

- The `_data_cleaning()` method takes a file location as input.
- It reads the specified data file, whether in Excel (.xlsx) or CSV (.csv) format, using pandas.
- The column headers are cleaned and converted to snake_case format, and the indexes are cleaned using the `_index_cleaning()` method.
- The cleaned DataFrame is returned.

##### 4. List Products (`list_products()`):

- The `list_products()` method returns a list of available products present in the data files.
- It iterates through the files attribute and extracts the product names from the file names by splitting on specific patterns.

##### 5. By Products (`by_product()`):

- The `by_product()` method takes the desired product as input and checks if it exists in the list of available products.
- If the product is found, it retrieves the data for that product using the `_data_cleaning()` method.
- The cleaned DataFrame for the selected product is returned.

##### 6. List Countries (`list_countries()`):

- The `list_countries()` method returns a list of all available countries present in the data files.
- Optionally, it accepts a string intext to filter the countries based on a specific text.
- It also provides an option to return countries grouped by regions if the intext matches specific region names.

##### 7. By Country (`by_country()`):

- The `by_country()` method takes the desired product and a list of countries as input.
- It retrieves the data for the selected product using the `by_product()` method and then filters it based on the given country list.
- The cleaned DataFrame with the selected product and countries is returned.

##### 8. List Years (`list_years()`):

- The `list_years()` method returns a list of available years present in the data files for the 'Education' product.
- It achieves this by calling the `by_country()` method with the 'Education' product and the list of all european countries.

##### 9. By Year (`by_year()`):

- The `by_year()` method takes the desired product, a list of countries, start year, and stop year as input.
- It retrieves the data for the selected product and countries using the `by_country()` method.
- The data is then filtered to include only the columns within the specified range of start and stop years.
- The cleaned DataFrame with the selected product, countries, and specified years is returned.

The data flow in the Preprocessor class involves reading data files, cleaning the data (columns and indexes), and providing methods to filter data based on products, countries, and time periods.

### B. Analyser Class

##### 1. Inheritance from Preprocessor:

- The `Analyser class` inherits from the `Preprocessor class`. This inheritance allows the `Analyser class` to access the methods and attributes of the `Preprocessor` class, enabling data preprocessing and filtering.

##### 2. Set Datafile (`set_datafile`):

- The `set_datafile` method takes the following inputs:
    * `product`: The desired product to be analyzed.
    * `country_list`: A list of countries to be analyzed.
    * `start_time`: The starting time or reference month for the analysis.
    * `stop_time`: The last month of the analysis period.
- The method sets the instance attributes `product`, `country_list`, `start_time`, and `stop_time` based on the input parameters.
- It then calls the `by_year` method inherited from the `Preprocessor class` to retrieve the data for the selected product, countries, and time period.
- The cleaned DataFrame containing the selected data is stored in the `data` instance attribute and also returned by the method.

##### 2. Inflation Calculator (`inflation_calculator`):

- The `inflation_calculator` method takes a well-formulated DataFrame `input_df` as input. This DataFrame is expected to be the result of previous functions and ready for analysis.
- The method calculates the inflation rate for each column in the DataFrame using the given formula.
- It creates new columns in the DataFrame with the calculated inflation rates for each time period.
- The DataFrame with the added inflation columns is returned as inflation_result.

##### 3. All Products Inflation (`all_products_inflation`):

- The `all_products_inflation` method calculates the inflation rates for all products available in a specific country during a given time period.
- The method takes the following inputs:
    * `nation`: The name of the country for which inflation rates are to be calculated.
    * `start_time`: The starting time or reference month for the analysis.
    * `stop_time`: The last month of the analysis period.
- The method retrieves the list of available products using the `list_products` method inherited from the `Preprocessor` class.
- It initializes an empty DataFrame `resultframe` to store the calculated inflation rates for all products.
- The method iterates over each product in the `product_list` and calls the `set_datafile` method to get the data for that product, country, and time period.
- The result DataFrame for each product is appended to `resultframe`.
- The index of `resultframe` is updated to include the product names for better identification.
- The final `resultframe` DataFrame containing inflation rates for all products and the specified country is returned.

The data flow in the `Analyser` class involves retrieving data from the `Preprocessor` class, calculating inflation rates, and merging the results for various products and a specified country over a specific time period. The class leverages the functionalities provided by the `Preprocessor` class to achieve data cleaning, filtering, and analysis.
